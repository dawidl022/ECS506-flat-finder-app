# 3. The Environment

## Reasons to build as a web application

### General reasons

- Almost all devices have access to an internet browser (citation needed about
  concrete numbers). Hence users can use it both on desktop and mobile devices,
  as long as they are connected to the internet (which is needed for the
  flat-finding functionality anyways).
- No need to update application from the user's side (citation about how this is
  problematic).
- Can be easily made to work with mobile devices via responsive web design, and
  even a progressive web app to make the experience even more seamless. As long
  as it runs fine on all major modern browsers, it will be cross platform out of
  the box. (citation about how this reduces dev time and hence costs).

### Client specific reasons

- Since FDM employees are consultants, they are likely to work on laptops and
  hence having access to the app on their laptops is convenient (weak argument).
- Making it a mobile only app would mean FMD would have to provide work phones
  if their employees were mandates to use the app (weak argument).

### Other software

- Many other flat finding apps are web apps (give examples). This is likely
  because finding places to live is not seen as a casual activity, but rather
  one with major future consequences (citations needed about how finding places
  to live are regarded in society). The ability to perform the use cases on a
  laptop/desktop allows for more fine-grained organisations (many open tabs
  etc.) (find studies about this casual vs professional internet browsing and
  the types of devices used for each).
- Find examples (if any) of mobile apps to discuss the other side of the
  argument. Many commercial flat finder apps do indeed have mobile variants,
  I believe that is because the Play/App stores are very popular and convenient
  for non-technical users. (citations about why companies invest in building
  mobile apps rather than adapting web apps to work well on mobiles). For our
  use case however, this cannot be justified as the app is not meant to be a
  commercial success, but rather be as convenient as possible for internal
  company usage.

## Write-up

The user-facing platform of choice for this project is a web application. Almost
all modern personal devices have access to an internet browser. Users will
be able to use the service both on desktop and mobile devices, as long as they
are connected to the internet (a necessary prerequisite for flat search to
work). Studies show that mobile devices have been capable of reasonable web
browsing for over 10 years (Schmiedl, Seidl and Temper, 2009), which means that
combined with desktop browsing, the largest number of users possible would be
able to access our app. Building a cross-platform app will keep the costs of
development relatively low.

Another advantage of going for a web application as opposed to a mobile
application, is that the user will not be responsible for updating any software;
all updates will happen on our side and all users will always be using
up-to-date software. This will prevent inconsistencies resulting from users on
different versions as well as increase security of the service, as
vulnerabilities patching will require no user input. The National Cyber Security
Centre (n.d.) recommends keeping software up to date to keep corporate data
safe. Studies have shown that about 41% of survey responders neglect software
updates, one of the reasons being that they are associated with the addition of
unnecessary new features (Armerding, 2012). A common solution to this problem,
is to indeed develop web applications, a technique used by companies such as
Facebook (Abraham, 2016).

Furthermore, with the now mature concept of responsive web design including
techniques such as mobile-first design, the user experience of web apps on
mobile devices can be enhanced while keeping costs low, compared to having to
develop separate applications for each platform (Gardner, 2011). Another
increasing popular practice is the development of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs),
used by successful companies such as Twitter, offering "fast, compelling
journeys similar to what can be achieved with a native app", whilst retaining
the benefits of a web app (e.g. instant updates) (Hume, 2017). Shipping a PWA
can be considered in later phases of the project, if there is user demand for
it.

Commercially successful flat finding services are offered as web applications,
such as Zoopla, Rightmove, OpenRent and SpareRoom. A hypothesised reason for
this is that the activity of searching for a place to live is regarded in most
societies as a serious task that can have a significant impact on the quality of
one's life, as a result of which, becomes a stressful endeavor for many
adolescents (Raviv et al. 1990). Stressful activities such as these are likely
to be performed more often on desktop devices than casual activities such as
browsing social media, as many users act and feel more organised with access to
a full desktop. This is backed by statistics as only around 50% of real estate
buyers use mobile apps (Leaxcoin (LEAX), 2020), whereas two-thirds of Facebook's
users access the platform only via its mobile application (Techjury, 2023). This
is why good desktop support is just as important as good mobile support, and
developing a web app allows for both with little compromises. 

On the other hand, all four of the above mentioned commercial flat finding
services are also offered as mobile applications. This is primarily to extend
their reach to predominantly mobile users via app stores such as Google Play or
Apple's App Store. The ratio of mobile to desktop users for property searches
had been on the rise in the recent years, meaning that if the commercial apps
wanted to stay competitive, they needed to also go mobile (Kan, 2016). While
this is perfectly understanding from the point of view of those businesses, our
use case is different in the sense that the application does not need be be a
commercial success, but rather but rather be as convenient as possible for
internal company usage. In addition, since our users will be tech consultants,
they will find a web application experience comfortable as they will be able to
use the service straight from their work devices (likely to be laptops), with
the option of accessing the app via their mobile web browser if needed.
