# 3. The Environment

## Reasons to build as a web application

### General reasons

- Almost all devices have access to an internet browser (citation needed about
  concrete numbers). Hence users can use it both on desktop and mobile devices,
  as long as they are connected to the internet (which is needed for the
  flat-finding functionality anyways).
- No need to update application from the user's side (citation about how this is
  problematic).
- Can be easily made to work with mobile devices via responsive web design, and
  even a progressive web app to make the experience even more seamless. As long
  as it runs fine on all major modern browsers, it will be cross platform out of
  the box. (citation about how this reduces dev time and hence costs).

### Client specific reasons

- Since FDM employees are consultants, they are likely to work on laptops and
  hence having access to the app on their laptops is convenient (weak argument).
- Making it a mobile only app would mean FMD would have to provide work phones
  if their employees were mandates to use the app (weak argument).

### Other software

- Many other flat finding apps are web apps (give examples). This is likely
  because finding places to live is not seen as a casual activity, but rather
  one with major future consequences (citations needed about how finding places
  to live are regarded in society). The ability to perform the use cases on a
  laptop/desktop allows for more fine-grained organisations (many open tabs
  etc.) (find studies about this casual vs professional internet browsing and
  the types of devices used for each).
- Find examples (if any) of mobile apps to discuss the other side of the
  argument. Many commercial flat finder apps do indeed have mobile variants,
  I believe that is because the Play/App stores are very popular and convenient
  for non-technical users. (citations about why companies invest in building
  mobile apps rather than adapting web apps to work well on mobiles). For our
  use case however, this cannot be justified as the app is not meant to be a
  commercial success, but rather be as convenient as possible for internal
  company usage.
